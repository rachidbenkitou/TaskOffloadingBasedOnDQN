 * This model uses the current Location of the device (from the Mobility.class) in order to calculate the next position
 * this model is over simplified , it doesn't use any speed or whatever, it is just used to give an example of how it works
 * you can create amore realistic model, or use the "MobilityManager" model provided by pureEdgeSim.
